# Telegram_Bot_Base

This is a base of the bot I'm using for Telegram. Some keypoints to note:

Bot Token and Bot username need to be generated by Bot Father on Telegram -> https://t.me/botfather
Follow this tutorial to learn how to generate your bot using bot father -> https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot

Once you have your token and username you can update the values in the Constants interface and run your bot. (Note this way of doing it isnt recommended)

There are some commands that I've created but the architecture may change.

There is a resource loader object that is just intended to point to the rivescript files in the resources folder.
Rivescript does have a subroutine I created as an example.

All invalid commands put in by the user defaults to the VOID command.
